2 For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to
escape; and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall
not hear, neither heart that shall not be penetrated.

          - Everyone will know what I know.
          - I have the opportunity today to act on jthat knowledge sooner than most.
          - What a privelege!


10 Unto the day when the Lord shall come to recompense unto every man
according to his work, and measure to every man according to the
measure which he has measured to his fellow man.

          - On the other side, the Lord will judge me according to the light I have.
          - I should be better, more focused on the Lord and His gospel.


14 ... and the day cometh that they who will not hear the voice of the Lord,
neither the voice of his servants, neither give heed to the words of the
prophets and apostles, shall be cut off from among the people;

          - That day is here I think.
          - "Our Savior and Redeemer, Jesus Christ, will perform some of His
            mightiest works between now and when He comes again. We will see
            miraculous indications that God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ,
            preside over this Church in majesty and glory. But in coming days, it
            will not be possible to survive spiritually without the guiding,
            directing, comforting, and constant influence of the Holy Ghost."
