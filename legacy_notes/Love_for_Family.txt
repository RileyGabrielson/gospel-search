John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that
whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
life.

      -I can't imagine giving my little girl up to such horrendous pain and suffering.
      -He REALLY loved us. Because His perfect Son was better than we deserved.
      -I am so grateful that God sent His Son Jesus Christ. I can't right now understand the depths of his love or mercy. But being a parent helps me to.


You and I accepted that invitation to be tested and to prove that we
would choose to keep the commandments of God when we would no longer
be in the presence of our Heavenly Father.

      - Being a parent is really tough. But I knew it would be. It is supposed
        to be.

Those of us who accepted the plan did so because of our faith in Jesus
Christ, who offered to become our Savior and Redeemer. We must have
believed then that whatever mortal weaknesses we would have and
whatever evil forces would be against us, the forces of good would be
overwhelmingly greater.

      - I've been struggling to be happy watching Gwen. I feel guilty for not
        wanting to watch her, cause I know that I should. I just feel inadequate
        all the time. Audrey is so amazing, she's a great mom and she has been
        refined into a strong parent.
      - But I knew that I would have mortal weaknesses. That I would be plagued
        by my own emotions. I knew that, and I had faith in the Lord and His plan.

Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ know and love you.

When you wonder how much pain you can endure well, remember Him. He
suffered what you suffer so that He would know how to lift you up. He
may not remove the burden, but He will give you strength, comfort, and
hope. He knows the way. He drank the bitter cup. He endured the
suffering of all.

      - Yes they do. I know that's true. They will help me be better.
      - A better father, a better husband, a better disciple.

As a Church, we believe in fathers. We believe in “the ideal of the
man who puts his family first.”2 We believe that “by divine design,
fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness
and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection
for their families.”3 We believe that in their complementary family
duties, “fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as
equal partners.”4 We believe that far from being superfluous, fathers
are unique and irreplaceable.

The perfect, divine expression of fatherhood is our Heavenly Father.
His character and attributes include abundant goodness and perfect
love.
...
Fathers in this fallen world can claim nothing
comparable to the Majesty on High, but at their best, they are
striving to emulate Him, and they indeed labor in His work. They are
honored with a remarkable and sobering trust.

      - This is a very important talk for me.
      - I remember when this talk was given, and I dismissed it. But now, words like
        "For men, fatherhood exposes us to our own weaknesses and our need to
        improve. Fatherhood requires sacrifice, but it is a source of
        incomparable satisfaction" speak to my core, cause it sums up my struggle
        at being a father.
      - I'm so out of my depth here. I do not feel up to the day to day things
        that I need to do, let alone the big picture things. I hope that at least
        Gwen will know that I love the Lord, and that I'm doing my best to know
        Him and His Son.


Helaman 5:13 And it came to pass that these were the words which Helaman taught to
his sons; yea, he did teach them many things which are not written,
and also many things which are written.

        - Helaman taught his kids so much, some that we have and some that we don't.
          How will my children remember me? How will I teach them?
